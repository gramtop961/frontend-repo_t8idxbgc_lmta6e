        <p>I’m [Your Name], a psychomotor therapist with a passion for movement and the mind. I combine professional training with a lifelong love of boxing and coaching to help people feel safe, strong, and seen.</p>
        <p>I started this work because I’ve seen how powerful it is when people reconnect with their body and their base. Movement tells the truth — and offers a way forward.</p>
