          <p>We imagine a world where everyone has the tools, support, and mindset to stay in balance — and to return to their base when life tilts. Movement is a doorway to self-understanding, connection, and growth.</p>

          <p>I help people feel good through movement. By combining psychomotor therapy with mindful boxing, you learn about yourself in action: recognise patterns, transform them into strength, and rediscover your balance.</p>
          <p className="mt-4">Boxing here is more than sport. It’s a practice of awareness — timing, choice, boundaries, focus, and emotion regulation. You learn to anticipate, choose, and act with intention.</p>
